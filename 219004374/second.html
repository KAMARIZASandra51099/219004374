        <p>"If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman."
           - Margaret Thatcher</p>
        <p>"It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent."
            -Madeleine Albright</p>
        <p>"Feminism isn't about making women stronger. Women are already strong, it's about changing the way the world perceives that strength."
            -G.D. Anderson</p>
        <p>"I am a woman / Phenomenally / Phenomenal woman / That's me."
            -Maya Angelou</p>
        <p>"You don't have to be pretty. You don't owe prettiness to anyone. Not to your boyfriend/spouse/partner, not to your co-workers, especially not to random men on the street. You don't owe it to your mother, you don't owe it to your children, you don't owe it to civilization in general. Prettiness is not a rent you pay for occupying a space marked 'female.'"
           -Erin McKean</p>
        <p>"A woman with a voice is, by definition, a strong woman."
        -Melinda Gates></p>
